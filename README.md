# muriel
Conway's Game of Life

## Plan
Basically, this will just be a TUI CGOL implementation with a basic layout like this:
```
Tick: 0
|x|x|x|x| | |
| |x| |x| |x|
| | | |x|x|x|
```

The exact layout and characters used might change, but that's not the point. What I plan on doing is making it so you can click on specific cells in the terminal while the simulation is happening. Maybe you could also click on start and stop buttons as well, or even a tickspeed slider or something cool. The point here is to learn how to do more complex terminal interactions in a cross-platform way (e.g. mouse interaction), which I have basically no idea how to do atm.

It's kind of late here, and I have a lot of work to do on other things right now, so I'll just leave the basic implementation here in hopes that I'll get around to the cool part when I have time.
